#The Family App

The Family App acts as a medium for families to interact with each other better.

The features of the family app are mentioned below:

Currently Included Features:  
  -registration of different users.  
  -multiple families of every user. Users can create multiple families (core family, extended family etc.) and add family members to them.  
  -checklist handeling: Users can create checklists which can be personal as well as belong to different families. This feature is important since any person who visits the market can view their family checklists and purchase items for them too.  
  -event: Users can create events(birthday parties, family dinner) for the families he is a part of and all members of the selected family will be notified for the same.  
  -task: Users can create personal tasks(eg: Shopping, Dining, Travelling) and will be notified if another family member is performing a task on the same date which falls in the same category that his own task belongs to. For eg if two people who have a common group are going for shopping on the same date then both will be notified about it and they can go for shopping toghether.  
  -notification system: Users will be notified whenever they are added to families, invited for events or if their family members are performing the same category task on the same day.  
  -user login and signup
  
Future scope(Tab added in the homepage but not implemented)
  -matrimony: If a person is available for marriage then family members can send proposals for marriage.  
  
The backend code is fully functional with database support and proper beans, repositories, services and controllers. The API's have also been tested. 
Front end has all components. However it is using static data currently to avoid database setup. cause of this adding of events/tasks will not reflect in the front end currently.
